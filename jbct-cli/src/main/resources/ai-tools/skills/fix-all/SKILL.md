# Fix All Issues

Your mission: Find and fix **every single issue** in the codebase. No exceptions. No shortcuts.

## Execution Protocol

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Run all available checks: linting, formatting, type checking, tests
   - Collect every warning, error, and issue
   - Create exhaustive list of problems to fix

2. **Systematic Resolution**
   - Fix issues one by one, starting with errors before warnings
   - After each fix, verify it doesn't introduce new issues
   - Track progress - mark each issue as resolved

3. **Verification Phase**
   - Re-run all checks after fixes
   - If new issues appear, add them to the list and fix them
   - Repeat until zero issues remain

4. **Completion Criteria**
   - All linters pass with zero warnings
   - All tests pass
   - All formatting checks pass
   - No remaining TODOs or FIXMEs (unless explicitly excluded)

## Mindset

This is a completeness challenge. Partial fixes are not acceptable. Either ALL issues are resolved, or the task is incomplete.

Be thorough. Be relentless. Don't stop until the codebase is clean.
